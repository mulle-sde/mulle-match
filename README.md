## Description

**mulle-match** matches filenames against a set of .gitignore like patternfiles
to categorize files according to their filenames and location.

Executable                   | Description
-----------------------------|--------------------------------
`mulle-match`                | Match filename according to .gitignore like patternfiles
`mulle-match-to-cmake`  | Use **mulle-match** to create cmake files

## Install

See [mulle-sde-developer](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer) how
to install *mulle-sde*, this will also install *mulle-bashfunctions* and
*mulle-match*.

Otherwise install
[mulle-bashfunctions](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer)
first and then after downloading *mulle-match* use its installer script
`./bin/installer --prefix /usr/local`.


## Commands

### init

Initialize the current directory with some patternfiles to match C/ObjC files
for demo purposes or as a starting point:

```
mulle-match init
```


### patternfile

A *patternfile* is made up of one or more *patterns*. It is quite like a
`.gitignore` file, with the same semantics for negation.


Example:

```
# match .c .h and .cpp files
*.c
*.h
*.cpp

# ignore backup files though
!*~.*
```

A *patternfile* resides in either the `ignore.d` folder or the
`match.d` folder. It's filename is composed of three segments.
The first digits-only segment is there to prioritize patternfiles. Lower
numbers are matched before higher numbers (`ls` sorting)
. The second segment gives the *type* of the file. And the last segment
is the *category* of the file. A *type* is required, a *category* is optional.

![](dox/mulle-match-match.png)

If a *patternfile* of the `ignore.d` folder matches, the matching has failed.
On the other hand, if a *patternfile* of the `match.d` folder matches, the
matching has succeeded. *patternfiles* are matched in sort order of their
filename.

> The [Wiki](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-match/wiki)
> explains this in much more detail.

Add a *patternfile* to select PNG files. We give it a type "hello":

```
echo "*.png" > pattern.txt
mulle-match patternfile install hello pattern.txt
```

You can optionally specify a *category* for the patternfile:

```
mulle-match patternfile install --category special hello pattern.txt
```

It may be useful, especially in conjunction with `mulle-match find`,
that large and changing folders like `.git` and `build` are ignored. Install the following *patternfile* into the `ignore.d` folder with `-i`:

```
echo ".git/" > pattern.txt
echo "build/" >> pattern.txt
mulle-match patternfile install -i folders pattern.txt
```
> But see [Environment](#environmet) for an even better and more efficient way of ignoring files
> and subdirectories.

Remove a *patternfile*:

```
mulle-match patternfile remove hello
```

List all *patternfiles*:

```
mulle-match patternfile list
```


### match

To test your installed *patternfile* you can use `mulle-match match`. It
will output the patternfile name if one matches.

```
mulle-match match pix/foo.png
```

You can also test individual *patterns* using the `--pattern` option:

```
mulle-match match --pattern '*.png' pix/foo.png
```


### list

This command lists the filenames that match *patternfiles*.
You can decide which *patternfile* should be used by supplying an optional
filter.

This example lists all the files, that pass through *patternfiles* of type
"hello":

```
mulle-match list --match-filter "hello"
```

The speed of the `list` command is highly dependent on a reduction of the search space with
the environment variables `MULLE_MATCH_FILENAMES`, `MULLE_MATCH_IGNORE_PATH`,
`MULLE_MATCH_PATH`.


## Environment

Variable                  | Description
--------------------------|---------------------------------------------
`MULLE_MATCH_FILENAMES`   | Filename wildcards separated by ':'. Only files matching these wildcards will be considered for. e.g. *.c:*.m:*.cmake. These values are evaluated with `find`'s `-name`. The default value is `*`
`MULLE_MATCH_IGNORE_PATH` | Locations to ignore separated by ':'. These values are evaluated with `find`'s `-path` and then pruned. The default value is `addiction:build:dependency:stash:include:lib:libexec:.git`
`MULLE_MATCH_PATH`        | Locations to search for separated by ':'. These values are passed to `find` as search starts. The default value is `.mulle/etc/sourcetree/config:src`
